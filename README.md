California State University San Marcos Computer Science Undergrad with a life-long passion for computer hardware and software.
I am currently working part-time at DGI Supply as a Junior Web/Software developer while I finish my undergrad at CSU San Marcos. I have experience in a wide range of     programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, C#, Typescript, Javascript, and many more. Feel free to check out some of my repositories here.
